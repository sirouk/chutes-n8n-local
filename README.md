# chutes-n8n-local

Self-hosted n8n with native `Login with Chutes`, bundled `n8n-nodes-chutes`, local `e2ee-local-proxy.chutes.dev` mode, and public-domain mode with ACME.

Build workflows with Chutes-native auth, multi-modal capabilities, and node integrations on top of n8n's orchestration, scheduling, webhooks, and automation runtime.

## Quick Start

macOS/Linux/WSL:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chutesai/chutes-n8n-local/main/deploy.sh?$(date +%s)")
```

The deploy script:

- clones or refreshes `chutesai/chutes-n8n-local`
- runs `deploy.sh`
- auto-clones `sirouk/n8n-nodes-chutes` beside it if missing
- fast-forwards `n8n-nodes-chutes` on clean reruns so the embedded nodes do not drift stale

When launched from a terminal, the deploy script prompts for install mode and the required Chutes OAuth settings even when invoked via `curl ... | bash`.

For headless or CI usage, preseed the required environment variables:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chutesai/chutes-n8n-local/main/deploy.sh | \
  INSTALL_MODE=local \
  CHUTES_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=... \
  CHUTES_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=... \
  bash
```

## Manual Clone


```bash
git clone https://github.com/chutesai/chutes-n8n-local.git
cd chutes-n8n-local
./deploy.sh
```

If `../n8n-nodes-chutes` is missing, deploy will clone:

```text
https://github.com/sirouk/n8n-nodes-chutes.git
```

You can override that source if needed (fork) with:

```bash
CHUTES_N8N_NODES_GIT_URL=git@github.com:sirouk/n8n-nodes-chutes.git ./deploy.sh
```

## Deploy

```bash
./deploy.sh
./deploy.sh --force
./deploy.sh --wipe
./deploy.sh --reset-owner-password
./deploy.sh --down
```

Deploy asks for, when a terminal is attached:

- install mode: `local` or `domain`
- existing-install action: `update` or `wipe`
- Chutes traffic mode: `direct` or `e2ee-proxy`
- if you pick `e2ee-proxy`, deploy also asks whether to keep it strict TEE-only for text models
- Chutes OAuth client ID and secret
- ACME email for `domain` installs

Mode behavior:

- `local`: serves n8n at `https://e2ee-local-proxy.chutes.dev` using the embedded e2ee-proxy certificate path
- `domain`: serves n8n on your real domain through Caddy with Let's Encrypt

Existing install behavior:

- `update` is the default and preserves Postgres and n8n data volumes
- `wipe` removes containers, volumes, and encrypted n8n state, then recreates everything cleanly

Chutes traffic mode:

- `direct`: the Chutes nodes use native Chutes endpoints and keep Chutes routing and failover behavior
- `e2ee-proxy`: OpenAI-compatible LLM text traffic uses the local `e2ee-proxy` path
  By default this follows `e2ee-proxy`'s TEE-only behavior. Deploy asks whether to keep that strict mode, and it writes `ALLOW_NON_CONFIDENTIAL` accordingly.
  While the backend `/e2e/*` SSO auth fix is rolling out, deploy also keeps `CHUTES_SSO_PROXY_BYPASS=true` so SSO-backed text execution stays direct. Once that backend fix is live, set it to `false` to send SSO text execution through `e2ee-proxy` too.

Traffic-mode scope:

- `local` / `domain` controls how n8n itself is exposed
- `direct` / `e2ee-proxy` controls how text-based Chutes LLM requests are executed
- chute discovery and non-text Chutes traffic stay on native Chutes endpoints

## What Deploy Builds

- Community n8n with native Chutes SSO
- baked-in `n8n-nodes-chutes`
- `postgres`
- one edge service:
  - `local-proxy` for local installs
  - `caddy` for public-domain installs
- optional `e2ee-proxy` sidecar for domain installs when `CHUTES_TRAFFIC_MODE=e2ee-proxy`

## Quality

```bash
./scripts/smoke-test.sh --syntax
./scripts/smoke-test.sh
./scripts/e2e-test.sh
```

- `smoke-test.sh --syntax` is safe anywhere
- `e2e-test.sh` is destructive and rebuilds the local test stack

CI runs syntax smoke checks plus the local test-IdP end-to-end path.

## Repo Layout

- `deploy.sh`: consolidated quick-start, install, and update entrypoint
- `docker-compose*.yml`: base, local, domain, and test stacks
- `Dockerfile.n8n`: pinned n8n build with SSO overlays and bundled Chutes nodes
- `n8n-overlays/`: native n8n backend and UI changes
- `scripts/`: deploy helpers, smoke tests, and E2E coverage
- `tests/test-chutes-idp/`: local test IdP for CI and destructive local E2E
